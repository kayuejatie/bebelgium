                Manchester united manager jose mourinho believes that the europa league may harm his side&#039;s premier league campaign and said it is a tournament the red devils kick off their europa league campaign against feyenoord on thursday evening, but mourinho appears to be less than excited. Two days after the manchester arena attack, jos√© mourinho&#039;s side showed grit to defeat ajax and win their first european trophy in nine years. Ajax amsterdam feiert nach dem weiterkommen gegen lyon.

    <h3>Jose mourinho has made history by becoming the first manager to win both major european trophies twice after manchester united clinched the europa league.</h3>
    <p>Jose mourinho says wednesday&#039;s europa league victory was validation for manchester united after being the worst team in the world at times this season. As manchester united prepare to take on copenhagen, we turn back the clock to 2016 when marcus rashford announced himself to the world against danish opponents midtjylland. Jose mourinho&#039;s manchester united won its third trophy of the season in the europa league final on wednesday night, a victory that also booked the team&#039;s place in next season&#039;s champions league. It wasn&#039;t just mourinho who had to sweat it out.</p>
